This is a study project with the basic database operations (CRUD) using Firebase Realtime Database, Firebase Authentication and Jetpack Compose for UI. I tried not to worry about application structure, architecture or some implementation pattern, the main goal with this project is to understand how to implement and use Firebase Products.
